### What is this ?
This is a project for searching repository commits on GitHub.

### Motivation
I made this project because I often needed to search through all the commits of a specific repo but I could not find the search functionality I wanted on GitHub, so I built my own search commits functionality and deployed it on a website.

### Deployment
This app is deployed on:

[Netlify](https://search-commit-messages-github.netlify.app/)
